                </h1>
                <p>
                    Ever faced the struggle of figuring out "what to do tonight"?  That's exactly why I built this app! I had this long-standing idea for a platform where users could easily share events, helping everyone discover things to do. When I stumbled upon a Next.js tutorial for building a similar app skeleton, it was the perfect starting point. I built upon that foundation, adding numerous features that balanced user needs with my own desire to explore technical aspects of development.

                    Building the Project
                </h2>

                The project's technical core is based on a project from Javascript Mastery on YouTube. I then significantly expanded it by adding a variety of features myself.

                Here are some of the key features I implemented:

                <ul className="pl-5 list-disc flex flex-col gap-3">
                    <li>
                        <span className="font-semibold">Event Location Management: Effortlessly manage event locations with features like:</span>
                        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
                            <li>Location search with autocomplete powered by Google Maps API.</li>
                            <li>Saving detailed venue information, including GPS coordinates.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Event Map View: Visualize all events on a user-friendly map interface.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        <span>Dedicated User Roles:</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Artists: Access features specifically designed for artists to showcase their talents.</li>
                            <li>Event Organizers: Create, manage, and promote events, including the ability to post artist recruitment ads.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Event Engagement:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Flash Events: Create time-sensitive events similar to Waze alerts.</li>
                            <li>User Posts with Photos: Allow users to share their experiences and add photos to events.</li>
                            <li>Event Saving: Let users keep track of interesting events for later.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 className="pt-7">Challenges and Learnings</h2>
                This project pushed me in a number of ways:

                        <p className="ml-6">I completely revamped the mobile navigation from the original project, opting for a bottom navigation bar that mimics the feel of popular social media apps. Tailwind's dimension thresholds made this process efficient.</p>

                I have a number of exciting plans for this project:

                <div className="flex flex-col gap-3 mt-3">
                    <div>
                        <p className="font-bold">Event Recommendations:</p>

                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p className="font-bold">Improve performance on image upload</p>
                        <p className="ml-6">Forms including images are really slow to submit. Goal is either to improve by migrating to another solution for images management or manage images in a asynchronuous way while the form is submitted.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
